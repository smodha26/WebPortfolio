      <p>Software Engineering at ÉTS</p>
      <p>01 September 2020 - 01 September 2024</p>
      <p>At École de Technologie Supérieure (ÉTS), my Software Engineering degree provided me with a solid grounding in both the theoretical and practical aspects of engineering. The program was rigorous and industry-focused, which aligned perfectly with my career goals. I delved into software systems, multimedia, cybersecurity, and intelligent systems, learning to design and develop complex software solutions. The cooperative education model at ÉTS allowed me to apply my knowledge in real-world settings through internships, significantly enhancing my problem-solving skills and technical expertise. The accreditation from the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB) added a layer of credibility to my qualifications, assuring that my education met the highest national standards.</p>
